# Files to reproduce GMD paper on evalhyd

The Python scripts contained in this directory make it possible to reproduce 
all scientific figures presented in our submission to the GMD journal, whose 
preprint is available at https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1424.

They must be executed in numerical order based on numbered file prefixes.

The relation between the scientific figures and the scripts are as follows:
- figures 5 and A2 can be reproduced using the script starting with prefix 4a;
- figures 6 and A3 can be reproduced using the script starting with prefix 4b;
- figure 7 can be reproduced using the script starting with prefix 5;
- figure 8 can be reproduced using the script starting with prefix 6;
- figure 9 can be reproduced using the script starting with prefix 7.
